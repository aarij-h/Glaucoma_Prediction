# Glaucoma_Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of glaucoma in patients using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly in the field of medical image analysis. By leveraging relevant eye-related data, the model is trained to identify early signs of glaucoma, a condition that can lead to blindness if left undiagnosed. The goal is to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and monitoring the disease more effectively, enabling timely intervention and better patient outcomes.
